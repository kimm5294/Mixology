# Synopsis
Mixology is a web application that allows users to search for mixed drinks by name or ingredient. This allows users to search for mixed drinks based on what they may already have at home. Selecting a drink displays the description, ingredients and a video tutorial on how to make it. Users can also create logins to save mixed drinks to their profile page to try later.
